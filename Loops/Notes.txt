1. While Loop
2. For Loop
3. Use Cases

loops is used for itteration purpose and loops allways work on range
allways have to use (:) colon while declaring loops
if we have any iterator then we have to use FOR Loop and if we have any condition then we have to use WHILE Loop

# FOR LOOP
range(10)
for range(10) # here defining the for loops
for i range(10) # Here "i" is a variable value
for i in range(10): # Here "i" comes "in" range value


# range also can contain start, end, increment or Decriment numbers
# range(startNumber,endNumber, Increment or Decriment)
# also for loop run till end Number -1

range(2,11,1)

#### Nested For Loop:



# WHILE LOOP
